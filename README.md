I'm Adolfo, an astronomer studying the evolution of massive binary systems towards the merger of compact objects, sources that the LIGO/Virgo collaboration is currently detecting.

I'm also interested in how (some) stars end their evolution and blow up :telescope:

I spend most of my day in front of the computer, either modelling stars or learning how to master vim (actually neovim) :computer:

### Reproducible science

I try to release every piece of work I own:

[MESA code used for a work we did on the progenitor population of two binary black hole mergers](https://github.com/asimazbunzel/mesa_low_mass_bbhs)

### Some codes

[syntax highlighting for the MESA code in vim (work in progress)](https://github.com/asimazbunzel/vim-mesa)

[fortran code to solve the 2 body problem using numerical routines from MESA](https://github.com/asimazbunzel/orbits)

[Roche potentials ! + a try to use the code in blender](https://github.com/asimazbunzel/roche-potential)

### Dotfiles

I use Manjaro linux on my computer, here is the repository with my dotfiles: [dots](https://github.com/asimazbunzel/mydotfiles)
