I'm Adolfo, an astronomer studying the evolution of massive binary systems which evolve towards the merger of compact objects, sources that the LIGO/Virgo collaboration is currently detecting.

I'm also interested in how (some) stars end their evolution and blow up :telescope:

I spend most of my day in front of the computer, either modelling stars or learning how to master vim (actually neovim) :computer:
